# STEPCPP
This hybrid beginner C++ crash course is 90% self-learning. I will post a code that usually takes about 3 hours of class for you to reverse engineer it. The exercises are simple as long as you follow the instruction correctly. We will cover data structure, arithmetic , array+vector and pointers. C++ is widely used in mostly engineering software thanks to its compiling speed. Regardless of your major, you are in the tech field. You will be working with a lot of engineers. You need C++. In facts, C++ is your college freshman class too.  This project will also cover c++ for LEGO EV3 and Arduino. 

writing the code:
1.) write the code on Notepad and use an online compiler. I recommend you to use Atom notepad. It has a better clarity than a regular Windows notepad. Then copy and paste the code to the online compiler like cpp.sh
2.) Use IDE. Microsoft Visual Studio. Eclipse. Atoms IDE. 
3.) write the code on Notepad and compile using terminal command line. 
ls - list the folder
cd - change directory
g++ - compile c++ file
./a.out - display c++ output
