# STEPCPP
This hybrid beginner C++ crash course is 90% self-learning. I will post a code that usually takes about 3 hours of class for you to reverse engineer it. The exercises are simple as long as you follow the instruction correctly. We will cover data structure, arithmetic , array+vector and pointers. C++ is widely used in mostly engineering software thanks to its compiling speed. Regardless of your major, you are in the tech field. You will be working with a lot of engineers. You need C++.  This project will also cover c++ for LEGO EV3 and Arduino.
